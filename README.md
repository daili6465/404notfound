This repository is for the Info 201 final project.

Pet owners and pet store owners were our target audience. Using the City of Seattle's data, we compiled information around pets licensed in the Seattle neighborhoods over 16 years. We created an interactive platform that informed our users about common pet names and total number of pets registered in Seattle. For instance, this can help pet owners with finding the right name for their new pet. This will also help pet store owners know when and where to open up businesses.

Another thing we found interesting was the discrepancies among numbers of pets registered in different neighborhoods in Seattle. Our platform can help the City of Seattle do better outreach to neighborhoods that do not have as many pets registered like South Seattle and downtown.
